# Run F# in Python Interactive with Fable

This extension adds the following commands for F# files. Note there is no shortcut configured by default, please set it up if needed.

1. Fable Python: Run current cell
2. Fable Python: Reset imports

The first command emulates `Jupyter: Run current cell`, but it can be used to send code to a Python Interactive direcly from an F# editor panel. Use `Py.NEW_CELL` (in Fable.Core) to declare new cells.

> **IMPORTANT**: For the extension to work correctly, Fable must be running in the background and generate files in the same location (with `.py` extension).

The extension automatically keeps track of the imports generated by Fable and only runs the new ones. If you need to reset the imports (e.g. after restarting Python Interactive or because sources have changed), run the command `Fable Python: Reset imports`.
